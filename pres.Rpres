- Weight is measured in pounds

- Height is measured in inches

BMI Implementation
========================================================
- The program was  implemented as an R Shiny App
- Consisted of two parts server.R and ui.R
- ui.R implemented the front end
- server.R implmented the back-end
- Two input fields were used - one for height and the other for weight

Conclusion
========================================================
- The reactive programming paradigm was used
- Compared to other framesworks it was found that Shiny had several benefits
